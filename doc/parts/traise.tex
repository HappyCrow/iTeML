The current usage is to use \texttt{(*\$T} and the following pattern for function \texttt{foo} and
exception \texttt{Bar}:

\begin{verbatim}
try ignore (foo x); false with Bar -> true
\end{verbatim}

If your project uses \bat{} and no pattern-matching is needed, then you can also use
the following, sexier pattern:

\begin{verbatim}
Result.(catch foo x |> is_exn Bar)
\end{verbatim}
