In a nutshell, \qtest{} is a small program which reads \texttt{.ml} and \texttt{.mli} source files and
extracts inline \ounit{} unit tests from them. It is used internally by the \OCaml{}
\bat{} project, and is shipped with it as of version 2.0, but it does not depend on
it and can be compiled and used independently.

Browse its code in the \bat\ Github
